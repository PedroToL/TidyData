# Skin Tone & Ethnic Identity in Mexico

This graph shows the proportion of individuals in each ethnic group (Afor-descendant, Indigenous, Mestizos, Whites and Others) per Skin Tone. 
Skin tonnes are simplified from the PERLA scale to form 4 groups: Dark-Skin, Brown, Light-Brown and Light-Skin (White).

## Data

I use data from the Inter-generational Social Mobility Module [(MMSI for its acronym in spanish) 2016](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/mmsi/2016/) conducted by INEGI.
