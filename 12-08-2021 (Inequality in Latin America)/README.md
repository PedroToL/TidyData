# Inequality in Latin America

This graph shows the relationship between GDP per Capita, the Ratio of People living in Urban to Rural Areas, and Population Density for different countries in Latin America.

## Data 
The database was generated from the open [World Bank Open Data Project](https://data.worldbank.org/). 

## Motivation
This plot is part of a bigger project where I analyse more inequality metrics in Latin America, If you are interested in checking it more thoroughly, you can check it out here:
